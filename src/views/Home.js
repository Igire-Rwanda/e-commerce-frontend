DESCRIPTION
The way the above e-commerce websites works; it allow anyone who wish to sell their products to upload their products with their details and put them in convenient category according to the type of products.
While our e-commerce restricts the freedom of everybody who is willing to sell products.
Our e-commerce website will recommend the retailers who wants to sell their products to first contact the admin so that they may be given permission to upload their products and categorise them.
Another thing about our e-commerce website is that it’s for retailers only which means that buying a single product won’t work .
Our system has three users: Admin, Retailers and clients
1.The Admin will be able to signup, login into his or her account, getall clients ,get clients by Id, update the clients and also delete clients .
Admin will also be able to create product, update product, get a single product, get all products, delete products, get all retailers, get all retailers, get retailers by Id, detele retailers, change status of retailers and manage users.
2.Retailer will be able to create an account, signin into the account, update or reset the password, create product, get all products, get product by Id, update product by Id, delete product by Id.
3.Client will be able to create an account an account, login, make orders,update an order, delete an order, make payment and cart products
 
Innovation: In this project admins are the only ones allowed to create,update and delete products.
This means that retailers who are willing to sell their products will first contact the admin so that the admin can permit the retailers to add their products on this e-commerce platform.
On our home page we will be having a link directing an allowed retailer to a form that will help them add the name of product, image of product, price and details of product as well as selecting the category of product
